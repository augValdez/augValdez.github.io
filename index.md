# Projects 
### [FindAGolfPro](https://github.com/augValdez/FindAGolfPro/tree/master)
This is my Senior Capstone for Westminster College. This is an Android Mobile App that will bring the outdated way of finding a golf professional up to date! This project uses React Native, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL to store and view information on golf pros and courses. Additionally using Google Maps API to make a user-friendly way of finding golf pros and courses near you. This project challenged my critical thinking skills from start to finish. With the new libraries, IDEs and languages I chose to use for this final project, my goal was to continuously learn during the duration of this project. I feel as though this project has given me a better understanding of O.O. software design as a whole. I also chose this project topic with the love of golf in mind. I know too many people who have tried to get into this hobby and simply were not able to find the resources because everything is drastically out dated. I feel as though being a CS student, the responsibility to keep things that we love up to date in the world is a huge priority.

### [Student Demographics](https://github.com/augValdez/StudentDemographics)
This is my final project for Databases that Hannah Freudenberger and I did. This was a demographics survey for the students of Westminster, where we took the students' answers from the survey we created and run different queries on their information. We used python and MySQLite. This final project gave us total freedom for our creativity, it was challenging working that closely with a partner as well as the creativity the project gave with having such a vague prompt.

### [Math Train Game](https://github.com/augValdez/MathTrainGame)
Software Engineering Project - Creating a game for 1st & 2nd graders to make learning basic math fun and easy. For this project I was in a group of 3 other women. At times this was very challenging especially after COVID-19 quarantine. We were all forced to work remotely. Collaboration and communication became very difficult due to the priorities we individually had. But in the end we finished a very cute functional math game.

### [Greedy Coin](https://github.com/augValdez/GreedyCoin)
This is a java program where you play a back and forth game with the computer to try and get the highest number of coins, and the highest number wins. This was one of the earlier projects I completed in my degree. This was a very challenging project and needed effective problem solving skills and critical thinking. Through the duration of this project, I learned the most substantial amount of concepts and techniques of object oriented programming. 

### [Bridges](https://github.com/augValdez/BFS-DFS-Bridges)
This project was using multiple different graphs given, and then using different algorithms such as breadth first search or depth first search. To find the best path and then upload the finalized graphs to bridges.com. This was also a project from earlier on in my degree that was very challenging yet and fulfilling project.
