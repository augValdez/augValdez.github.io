# Projects 
### [FindAGolfPro](https://github.com/augValdez/FindAGolfPro/tree/master)
This is my Senior Capstone for Westminster College. This is an Android Mobile App that will bring the outdated way of finding a golf professional up to date! This project uses React Native, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL to store and view information on golf pros and courses. Additionally using Google Maps API to make a user-friendly way of finding golf pros and courses near you. This project challeged my critical thinking from start to finish. With the new libriaries, IDEs and languages I choose to use for this final project, my goal was to continiously learn during the duration of this project. I feel as though this project has given me a better understanding of overall O.O. software design. I also choose this project topic with the love of golf in mind. I know too many people who have tried to get into the hobby and simply was not able to find the resources because everything is very out dated. I feel as though being a CS student the responsibility to keep things that we love up to date in the world is a huge priority.

### [Student Demographics](https://github.com/augValdez/StudentDemographics)
This is final project for Databases that Hannah Freudenberger and I did. It is a student demographics survey for the students of Westminster, where we take students answers from a survey we created and run different queries on their information. We used python and mySQLite for our Project. This was a final project that had total freedom to dod what we wanted, it was challenging working that closely with a partner as well as the creativity the project gave with having such a vague prompt.

### [Math Train Game](https://github.com/augValdez/MathTrainGame)
Software Engineering Project - Creating a game for 1st & 2nd graders to make learning basic math fun and easy. For this project I was in a group of 3 other women. At times this was very challenging especailly after COVID-19 quarentine happened and we were all removed to remote. Collaboration and Communication became very difficult due to the priorities we each individually had. But in the end we finished a very cute functional math game.

### [Greedy Coin](https://github.com/augValdez/GreedyCoin)
This is a java program where you play of a back and forth game with the computer to try and get the highest number of coins, and the highest number wins. This was one of the earlier projects I completed in my degree. This was a very challenging project and needed effective problem solving skills and critical thinking. Through the duration of this project, I learned most likely the most substancial amount of the understanding conecepts and techniques of object oriented programming. 

### [Bridges](https://github.com/augValdez/BFS-DFS-Bridges)
This project was using multiple different graphs given, and then using different algorithms such as breadth first search, or depth first search, to find the best path and then uploading finalized graphs to bridges.com. This was also a project from earlier on in my degree that was very challenging, and with that I choose it because this was one of the projects that was super fulfilling to complete.
