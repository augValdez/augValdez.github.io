### [FindAGolfPro](https://github.com/augValdez/FindAGolfPro/tree/master)
This is my Senior Capstone for Westminster College. This is an Android Mobile App that will bring the outdated way of finding a golf professional up to date! This project uses React Native, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL to store and view information on golf pros and courses. Additionally using Google Maps API to make a user-friendly way of finding golf pros and courses near you.
