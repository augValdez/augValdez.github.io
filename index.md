# Welcome to Augustine's Portfolio
## I will be graduating this semester with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Westminster College in Salt Lake City. This is my Senior Capstone Portfolio.  

# Projects 
### [FindAGolfPro](https://github.com/augValdez/FindAGolfPro/tree/master)
This is my Senior Capstone for Westminster College. This is an Android Mobile App that will bring the outdated way of finding a golf professional up to date! This project uses React Native, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL to store and view information on golf pros and courses. Additionally using Google Maps API to make a user-friendly way of finding golf pros and courses near you.

This is final project for Databases that Hannah Freudenberger and I did. It is a student demographics survey for the students of Westminster, where we take students answers from a survey we created and run different queries on their information.

### [Math Train Game](https://github.com/augValdez/MathTrainGame)
Software Engineering Project - Creating a game for 1st & 2nd graders to make learning basic math fun and easy.

### [Greedy Coin](https://github.com/augValdez/GreedyCoin)
This is a java program where you play of a back and forth game with the computer to try and get the highest number of coins, and the highest number wins.

### [Bridges](https://github.com/augValdez/BFS-DFS-Bridges)
This project was using multiple different graphs given, and then using different algorithms such as breadth first search, or depth first search, to find the best path and then uploading finalized graphs to bridges.com.
